# Shop Repairable!
This is an incomplete guide to help you making the right decision when you have to buy something and care for repairability.

If you have a good idea how to "render" this guide in a more flexible way, feel free to create an issue. In an ideal world, I'd love to have the guide as editable document on github or similar, readable on mobile devices as well as a nicely formatted version for prints (A5). Maybe that world actually exists?
